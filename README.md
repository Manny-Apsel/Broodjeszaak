# Broodjeszaak
A technical interview test I had to finish as part of a interview proces. UI is made in dutch.

## Goal
Create a UI for a sandwhich shop so their clients can order sandwhiches. Choose your sort of bread, topping, saus and eventual 'smos' (i.e. different types of salad with pickles)
Automatically calculate price whenever an option is selected and show it to the customer.
Once a sandwhich order has been made a small text box will show the order.
Keep a list of all sandwhich orders that need to be fulfilled.
You can either select an order and tell the program it has been fulfiled or you can cancel an order.
Once an order has been fulfilled show a text with details of the order and keep a list with all the orders fulfilled.
