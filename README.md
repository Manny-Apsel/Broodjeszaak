# Broodjeszaak
A technical interview test I had to finish as part of a interview proces. UI is made in dutch.

## Goals
- Create a UI for a sandwhich shop so their clients can order sandwhiches. Choose your sort of bread, topping, saus and eventual 'smos' (i.e. different types of salad with pickles).
- Automatically calculate price whenever an option is selected and show it to the customer.
- Once a sandwhich order has been made a small text box will show the order.
- Keep a list of all sandwhich orders that need to be fulfilled.
- You can either select an order and tell the program it has been fulfiled or you can cancel an order.
- Once an order has been fulfilled show a text with details of the order and keep a list with all the orders fulfilled.

## Improvements that could be made
- Bind XAML objects with c# objects instead of hardcoding it
- Add functionality by subdividing items in excel to Bread, Topping, Sauce and others so anybody could quickly add/remove items from program or edit their prices.
- Lists don't use 2 decimals after comma in the price column
- Pre-select items on start-up
